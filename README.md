# RRCB-redesign

The website of RRCB, New Delhi redesigned using HTML CSS & Bootstrap as **only a fun project**. 
I added some images and better designing to the original website, removed unneccessary elements and made it more mobile-friendly and minimalistic.
Here's a link to the <a href="https://rrcb.gov.in/">original website</a> in case you wanna compare.
